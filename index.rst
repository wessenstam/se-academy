**Associate SE Training Framework**

Use this framework for the enablement of the Associate SEs. The core topics will need to fit around the day-to-day requirements of the SE Manager, time for the ASEs to become acclimatised, online learning, exams as well as New Hire Training being factored into the timetable.
